## Prerequisites

You must have valid public and secret keys for Flexpa API. Contact us [here](https://automatemedical.typeform.com/to/mtwkkY2r?typeform-source=quickstart) to obtain them.
Once you have the API keys, you're ready to go!

Node must be installed on your machine.

## Clone the Repository

First you must clone the quickstart repository. You can do this using HTTPS:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flexpa/quickstart.git
cd quickstart
```

Or by using SSH:

```bash
git@github.com:flexpa/quickstart.git
cd quickstart
```

## Update environment variables

You'll need to add your Flexpa public and secret keys to a `.env.local` file.
Rename the file `.env.template` to `.env.local` and update the values to include your public and secret keys.
During development, you will likely want to use the test mode keys rather than the production ones.

## Run the Project

First, run the development server:

```bash
nvm use

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
